> This repository is for the learners of this course to **only** have a sense of the instructions specified in the guidelines of the problem sets and for other referencing purposes. It's pointless to mindlessly copy-paste given that you want to learn how to actually write programs. Please be aware of **CS50's** [**Academic Honesty**](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2021/honesty/).
